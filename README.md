# TarkovTools

Tarkov tools is a project to make adding content to SPT easier for everyone. The goal is a complete editor with all the required tools to make any piece of content availiable. For now we start with quests and move onto other things down the road. This is still early in development and bugs will exist, however I believe its mature enough to begin public testing. That said, current best practice is to always make a new quest and locale file. `I do not recommend using this on a file you currently have working in a production environment.`

Users always make sure to report bugs at the issues section here: https://github.com/dirtbikercj/TarkovTools/issues
